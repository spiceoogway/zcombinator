**Overview**

Introduce fees, claimable by devs for specific reasons, with each claim put to a decision market.

The lack of fees hampers development of projects where there are significant dev, infra costs etc. Whilst minting tokens serves a purpose, it cannot replace the short-term ability of fees to provide start up funds for projects which incur significant costs.

My proposal is to introduce 'creator fees', as seen in other launchpads, but with these reserved and only claimable by devs for specific reasons, and with each claim put to a decision market. In the shorter term, this provide essential capital to a project team, but at the discretion of holders and, in the medium to long term the option to mint tokens as is currently standard. Each option serves a clear, predefined purpose to support development.

This will also serve to increase interest in the launchpad with potential teams seeing multiple mechanisms to fund a project whilst keeping holders at the core of decisions.

**Developer Note** (@handsdiff)

If passed, I will edit the config for ZC launches to include 1% trading fees on both the bonding curve and DAMMv2. Fees will initially be claimable by the main protocol wallet that also controls mint authority and manages LP: Hq7Xh37tT4sesD6wA4DphYfxeMJRhhFWS3KVUSSGjqzc. When decision markets are run on project tokens to claim certain amounts of fees for whatever reason, the protocol will distribute the fees specified in the decision market (or the entire claimable fees for that token) to the wallet that created the token and is eligible for claiming the daily emissions of that token. Z Combinator will take a 10% fee on all fee disbursements, for later use in tokenomics.
